# SolarSSH

This project is a cloud-based server that enables accessing SolarNode devices
via a SSH tunnel. It works with the [SolarNode System SSH][system.ssh] plugin to
establish a SSH connection between the SolarNode and this SolarSSH server and
then allows web browser-based terminal access through the SSH connection.
